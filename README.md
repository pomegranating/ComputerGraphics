# Assessment Project - Python3 and File Processing

This project includes the implementation and documentation of tasks related to setting up a Python3 development environment, working with files, and processing a a massive dataset ( which was provided in the CAT instructions).

## Task 1: Python3 Development Environment (10 Marks)

1. **Setting up Python3 Development Environment:**
   - Installed [all necessary dependencies](#dependencies) for the Python3 development environment taht are indicated.


2. **Python Project Structure:**
   - Each member in the group created a Python project using the PyCharm structure. (The name of the project varied depending on the individuals way of creating the directory.)

3. **Importing the Dataset:**
   - Imported the MASSIVE Dataset mentioned in the data file. (The massive dataset can be found in the folderas well)

4. **Data Processing:**
   - Generated en-xx.xlsx files for all languages in the dataset, considering English as the pivot language.
   - This was done using the file named .py 
   - The group members managed to avoid using recursive algorithms to optimize time complexity while generating the required files..

5. **Flags and bash scripting:**
   - Utilized flags and bash scripting to facilitate running the solution on generator.sh files.
