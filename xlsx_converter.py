# Replace 'your_file.tar' with the name of your .tar file

# Extract the .tar file
with tarfile.open(tar_file, 'r') as tar:
    tar.extractall()

# Now, you can read the extracted files using pandas if they contain data in a supported format.
# For example, if the extracted files are CSVs:
import pandas as pd

# Read a CSV file from the extracted files
df = pd.read_xlsx('extracted_file.xlsx')

# You can now work with 'df' as a pandas DataFrame
